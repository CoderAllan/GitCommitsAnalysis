Any ideas, bug reports or help building this tool, is greatly appreciated.

## Bugs

If you find a bug feel free to post a issue describing the steps to reproduce the issue and what the expected behavior should have been. The GitHub issue template should guide you.

## ideas

This tool can be extended in a lot of ways, but this is a hobby project for me and I have only limited time to work on it, so if you have a great idea, create a feature request in the issues section and i will have a look at it.

To increase to probability of the feature getting implemented you could help by creating a pull request with an implementation of the feature and I will give it a serious look.
